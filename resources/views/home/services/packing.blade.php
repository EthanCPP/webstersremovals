				<h5 class="mt-0">Packing</h5>
				<p>Packing is often the most time consuming part of the move, ideally it should be completed before the day of removal, with goods packed into sturdy cartons for ease of handling and safe storage on the removal vehicle. If required our staff can complete the packing for you, this can be a complete packing service or pack on a selective basis, i.e. fragile goods only. Should you choose to undertake your own packing, along with advice a full range of professional packing materials can be collected from our Tenby warehouse, various size cartons, wrapping paper, bubblewrap and box sealing tape are available.</p>
